Blobs are binary large objects that store unstructured data in databases. In the context of blockchain data, blobs can be used to store various types of information, such as images, documents, or other binary data related to blockchain transactions, smart contracts, or other blockchain-related entities. Blobs are typically stored in databases as binary data and can be retrieved and processed as needed. For example, blobs can be used to store images of NFTs, documents related to smart contracts, or other large data files that are associated with blockchain entities.
