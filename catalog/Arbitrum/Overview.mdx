Arbitrum is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, designed to improve the performance and reduce the costs associated with decentralized applications (DApps) on the Ethereum network. Launched by Offchain Labs, Arbitrum enhances Ethereum’s scalability while maintaining its security and decentralization. By using rollup technology, Arbitrum enables faster and cheaper transactions, making it an attractive platform for developers and users alike.
### The Major Features of the Arbitrum Blockchain

1. **Scalability**: Arbitrum significantly increases the scalability of Ethereum by aggregating multiple transactions into a single batch, which is then processed off-chain before being committed to the Ethereum main chain. This rollup technique reduces the load on the Ethereum network, allowing for thousands of transactions per second while maintaining low latency.

2. **Low Fees**: By processing transactions off-chain and only recording the final state on the Ethereum main chain, Arbitrum drastically reduces transaction fees. This cost efficiency makes it more affordable for users and developers to interact with decentralized applications, fostering greater adoption and usage.

3. **EVM Compatibility**: Arbitrum is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), enabling developers to deploy their existing Ethereum-based smart contracts and DApps on Arbitrum with minimal modifications. This compatibility ensures a seamless transition for developers and allows them to leverage Ethereum’s extensive ecosystem of tools and libraries.
