## 1.polygon.token_metas
### Table Description
Token metadata in the context of blockchain and cryptocurrencies typically refers to the set of data that describes the characteristics and details of a particular token. This metadata can include information such as the token's name, symbol, total supply, decimal precision, and other details relevant to its function and identity on the blockchain. It's essentially the descriptive data that gives context and identity to a token, distinguishing it from other tokens within the same blockchain ecosystem. Metadata is crucial for understanding the nature and purpose of a token, especially in applications like wallets, exchanges, and decentralized applications (dApps) where users interact with various types of tokens.
