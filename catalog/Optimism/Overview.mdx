Optimism is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, designed to enhance the scalability and reduce the transaction costs of decentralized applications (DApps) on the Ethereum network. Developed by the Optimism Foundation, Optimism leverages optimistic rollup technology to achieve faster and cheaper transactions while maintaining the security and decentralization of the Ethereum main chain.
### The Major Features of the Optimism Blockchain

1. **Scalability**: Optimism significantly improves the scalability of Ethereum by using optimistic rollups, which aggregate multiple transactions into a single batch processed off-chain. This technique allows Optimism to handle thousands of transactions per second, reducing congestion and enhancing the overall performance of the network.

2. **Low Fees**: By processing transactions off-chain and only recording the final state on the Ethereum main chain, Optimism dramatically reduces transaction fees. This cost efficiency makes it more accessible for users and developers to interact with decentralized applications, promoting greater adoption and usage.

3. **EVM Compatibility**: Optimism is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), enabling developers to deploy their existing Ethereum-based smart contracts and DApps on Optimism with minimal modifications. This compatibility ensures a seamless transition for developers and allows them to leverage Ethereum’s extensive ecosystem of tools and libraries.
