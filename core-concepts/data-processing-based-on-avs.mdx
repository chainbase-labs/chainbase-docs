title: 'Data Processing Based on AVS'

## **Overview**

Chainbase Network is an hyperdata network powered by a [dual-chain](/core-concepts/dual-chain) architecture using Cosmos and EigenLayer, enabling trustworthy and transparent on-chain data processing. Through the [Manuscript protocol](/core-concepts/manuscript) on the Chainbase Virtual Machine (CVM), the network ensures seamless data interoperability. By integrating [EigenLayerâ€™s](https://www.eigenlayer.xyz/) staking mechanism, Chainbase leverages Ethereum's economic security to build a high-performance AVS for its [Execution Layer](/core-concepts/architecture/execution_layer). This ensures large-scale data processing while maintaining security, decentralization, and scalability, supporting the growing demands of blockchain applications.

The execution layer nodes of Chainbase Network are built on EigenLayer, providing users with a node network for on-chain data processing. Developers can submit Manuscript data processing programs and request the final result dataset. EigenLayer operators with computational resources can restake and register as execution layer nodes of Chainbase Network, providing the required computing resources. As Chainbase Network integrates data query fees, restakers will generate income from it.

As more and more Manuscripts run on Chainbase Network, more high-quality computing resources are needed. To achieve elastic scaling of resources while maintaining high throughput, on-chain computing tasks need to be routed to the best provider according to the running preferences of Manuscript. Key factors include node geographic location (latency), computing hardware, and network environment. EigenLayer will support Chainbase Network through diversified operators and routing strategies to meet these needs.

### **Summary**

Chainbase Network is a full-chain data network supported by the dual-chain architecture of Cosmos and EigenLayer, aiming to provide a trustworthy and transparent data processing environment. To achieve interoperability, the Manuscript protocol was developed and runs on the Chainbase Virtual Machine (CVM), designed for large-scale data processing.

By combining EigenLayer's staking mechanism, Chainbase Network enhances economic and safety guarantees and builds a high-performance execution layer. EigenLayer operators can register as nodes of Chainbase Network, provide computing resources, and profit through integrated data query fees.

With the increase of Manuscript operations, the system needs more high-quality computing resources, and EigenLayer provides diversified operators and routing strategies to support this demand.
