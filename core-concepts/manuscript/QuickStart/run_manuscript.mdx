### 2. 📚 Network
We are about to launch the Chainbase network Manuscript environment, allowing users to deploy Manuscript directly to the Chainbase network.


## Deployment Options
There are three ways to deploy your Manuscript:

### 1. 🚗 Using the GUI Tool
Edit and deploy your Manuscript directly within the GUI. This is the most straightforward and efficient method.

### 2. 🚌 Using Docker Compose
Copy the docker-compose file from the [Manuscript-Core](https://github.com/chainbase-labs/manuscript-core/tree/main/examples) repository to deploy it locally.

### 3. 🚅 Using Manuscript-Lib (Coming Soon)
Deploy your Manuscript with a single click through the Manuscript-Lib browser.
