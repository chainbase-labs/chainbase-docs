## Delegators

Delegators enhance the economic security of the network by staking their tokens to validators and operators. The Chainbase network uses a dual staking mechanism, where delegators can choose to stake `$ETH (or $LST)` and `$C`.

### Staking Tokens

Delegators can stake their tokens to support validators and operators, contributing to the network's security and stability.

1. **Choose Tokens**: Decide whether to stake `$ETH (or $LST)` or `$C`.
2. **Select Validators/Operators**: Choose the validators and operators you want to support.
3. **Stake Tokens**: Use the staking interface to delegate your tokens to the selected validators and operators.

### Earning Rewards

By staking tokens, delegators earn a share of the rewards earned by the validators and operators they support.
