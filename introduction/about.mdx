Chainbase is the world's largest **hyperdata network** designed to integrate all blockchain data into a unified ecosystem, providing an open and transparent data interoperability layer for the AI era. 

It has designed a novel **dual-chain** technology architecture that bridges the programmability and composability of crypto data, which supports high throughput, low latency, and eventual determinism, as well as higher cybersecurity through a dual staking model.

Our mission is to **make data accessible and useful**. With Chainbase, people can truly enjoy the benefits of the open internet era.
