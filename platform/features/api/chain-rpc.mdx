## EVM RPC API

### What is the EVM RPC API?

The EVM RPC API enables applications to connect to an Ethereum-compatible node supported by Chainbase. By utilizing the API's endpoints, developers can interact with on-chain data and send various types of transactions to the network. The API adheres to the JSON-RPC standard, which is a stateless, lightweight remote procedure call (RPC) protocol frequently used for interacting with Ethereum.

### Supported networks
