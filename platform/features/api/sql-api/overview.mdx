## What is SQL API?

The Chainbase SQL API lets you run your low-latency queries through an endpoint to leverage all our indexed datasets for your custom needs.

The SQL API is powered by Chainbase's [Data Cloud](/platform/features/datacloud/overview), a fully managed online data warehouse service for Web3 developers.  Developers can query the data warehouse through the **SQL API** to access our datasets with zero infra cost.  And the **Data Cloud**'s scalable, distributed analytical data engine and intelligent data modeling allow you to query terabytes of data **in seconds**.
