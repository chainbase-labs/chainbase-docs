## Overview

In Web3, Webhooks are designed as a powerful and convenient toolkit designed to bridge the gap between On-Chain events and Off-Chain monitors. By providing real-time monitoring capabilities, Webhook ensures that users are always on the pulse of the decentralized world.

Its core advantages are its **real-time, customizability and reliability**. Whether you're a dApp developer looking to enhance your user experience or a business looking for seamless blockchain integration, Webhook's real-time data synchronization gives you a competitive advantage in the fast-paced Web3.

## Scenarios

From transactions monitoring to DeFi, and NFT dApps building, Webhook become more and more popular in Web3 toolkits and dApps development. We could not only develop a bunch of On-Chain data monitoring toolkits but also build some complex dApps. Here are some examples

- **Monitor Assets**: Get real-time notifications when an asset is being sent, received, staked, swapped, or burned. This is particularly useful for exchanges and DeFi applications where the dynamics of assets are frequently changing.
- **Real-Time Wallet Notifications**: Monitor when an address sends, receives, stakes, swaps, or burns assets. This feature can also be used in tracking unauthorized transactions for security purposes.
- **Token Sales Activities**: Receive notifications when someone participates in your token sale. This could significantly enhance marketing and sales strategies by understanding investor behavior in real-time.
- **Smart Contract Event Monitoring**: Trigger on-chain events based on your filters. Real-time contract interaction information can be obtained through the webhook. For example, when a smart contract method is invoked or the state variables change.
- **NFT trade tracking**: Use webhooks to monitor the release and trading activities of specific artists or series of NFTs. Both collectors and market investors can be notified in real-time, greatly increasing their chances of bidding for the works.
