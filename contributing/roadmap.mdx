**Summary**

In ancient lore, aquamarine was the sailor‚Äôs stone, offering protection, clarity, and guidance across uncharted waters. It symbolized transformation and renewal, much like the evolution of Chainbase as it advances into its next phase. While Zircon (Genesis) laid the bedrock for a secure and decentralized data network, Aquamarine represents the fluid expansion of this foundation‚Äîdeepening Web3‚Äôs data ecosystem, refining public data standards, and pioneering on-chain AI collaboration.

This phase is crucial as AI and Web3 begin to converge, demanding more scalable, intelligent, and interconnected data solutions. Aquamarine will establish Chainbase as a fundamental public data platform in the AGI era, equipping AI Agents with the infrastructure they need to collaborate and evolve. As the tides of decentralized intelligence rise, Aquamarine is the vessel that will navigate this new frontier.

**Summary**

The ‚ÄúZIRCON (Genesis)‚Äù project marks the beginning of a groundbreaking chapter for Chainbase, aiming to build a unified, secure, and decentralized data network. This ambitious initiative seeks to set new standards in data protocols, decentralized computing and storage, and developer incentives. It also focuses on training sophisticated crypto-world models and empowering users with cutting-edge AI tools. As Chainbase evolves, it will support a thriving data ecosystem, enhance protocol efficiency, and serve the ever-expanding needs of Web3.

**Omnichain Data Standards**

Result: Build a standard protocol that can combine and utilize all data on the network.

**Decentralized Network**

Result: Decentralized computing, storage and validation, and providing services.

**Developer Community Economy**

Result: Rewards for developers who create data(manuscripts) value in the network.

**Crypto World Model**

Result: Training crypto-world models to go beyond knowledge and become intelligent.

**Users Empowerment**

Result: Supporting non-expert crypto users with enhanced AI models and tools.

Through efforts in these five key areas, Chainbase will lay a solid foundation for the data ecosystem in the AI era, driving innovation and development in onchain data.
