title: 'Run a Chainbase AVS Operator (Not released to mainnet yet)'
---

## Overview

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and running a Chainbase AVS (Actively Validated Service) operator node. Please note that this service is not yet released to the mainnet.

## Requirements

Recommended Hardware Specifications

| Class | vCPUs (10th gen+) | Memory | Networking Capacity |
|-------|-------------------|--------|---------------------|
| General Purpose - large | 2 | 8 GB | 5 Mbps |
| General Purpose - xl | 4 | 16 GB | 25 Mbps |
| General Purpose - 4xl | 16 | 64 GB | 5 Gbps |

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

➕[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/): Docker is a requirement for AVS operator.

➕[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/):  Docker Compose is used alongside Docker for executing Operator software.

➕ **Linux Environment**: Eigenlayer’s CLI only runs in a Linux environment.

➕[Go](https://go.dev/doc/install): Two out of three installation routes require the use of Go. It’s safer to go with Go than go without. 😉


## Installation Process

### Migration From Previous Version

If you've previously run a Chainbase AVS Operator:
1. You can delete old version `chainbase-avs-setup` directory on your server, but need to back up your encrypted **ECDSA** and **BLS** keys.
2. Skip the **EigenLayer Registration** step and only start from **Chainbase AVS Setup** step.

### EigenLayer Registration

Ensure you've registered with EigenLayer before proceeding. For guidance, refer to the [EigenLayer Operator Installation Guide](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/operator-guides/operator-installation).

### Chainbase AVS Setup

1. Clone the Chainbase AVS setup repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/chainbase-labs/chainbase-avs-setup && cd chainbase-avs-setup/holesky
   ```

2. Set up the environment file:
```
mv .env.example .env
   ```
Configure all fields in the `.env` file with your specific information:
```
NODE_ECDSA_KEY_FILE_PATH=/your/ecdsa/key/path
NODE_BLS_KEY_FILE_PATH=/your/bls/key/path
OPERATOR_ECDSA_KEY_PASSWORD=yourECDSAKeyPassword
OPERATOR_BLS_KEY_PASSWORD=yourBlsKeyPassword
OPERATOR_ADDRESS=yourECDSAKeyAddress
NODE_SOCKET=yourNodeSocket
   ```
- **OPERATOR_ADDRESS**: Set to your operator address (must match your ECDSA key address). You can run `eigenlayer operator keys list` to check your opertor address.
- **NODE_SOCKET**: Set to your server's public IP address (format: `<your_server_public_ip>:8011`).

Important:
- Ensure your server's public IP is internet-accessible.
- Verify that port 8011 is open and properly configured in your firewall settings.

3. Configure `${YOUR_OPERATOR_NAME}` filed in `prometheus.yml` file.

Replace this with your Operator name you want to be identified by, it helps us route alerts and metrics to your notification channels easily

4. Set execution permissions for the script:
```shell
chmod +x ./chainbase-avs.sh
```

## Operating the Chainbase AVS

### Register as an Operator

Run the following command to register as an operator:
```shell
./chainbase-avs.sh register
```
### Run Node

Run the following command to startup node:
```shell
./chainbase-avs.sh run
```
### Test Node

Run the following command to test node:
```shell
./chainbase-avs.sh test
```
If you see the output `All systems are working for your manuscript node` in the command line output, it indicates that your node is running correctly.
### Update Node socket

If your server's public IP address is changed after you register as an operator, you need to update the node socket.
Configure `NODE_SOCKET` in `.env` file, then run the following command:
```shell
./chainbase-avs.sh update
```
### Stop Node

Run the following command to stop node:
```shell
./chainbase-avs.sh stop
```

### Monitor Logs

View container logs using any of these commands:
```shell
docker compose logs -f
docker compose logs -f <container_name>
docker logs -f <container_id>
```

### Dashboard

You can visit `<your_server_public_ip>:3000` to view the dashboard to confirm the status of your node.
